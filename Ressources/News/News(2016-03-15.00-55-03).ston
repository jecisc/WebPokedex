WPNews {	#title : 'First version!',	#content : '<p> Hi, </p>\r<p> This is the first version of the application. For now this is really small and you can\'t do a lot, but in the future this might evolve (No. No. No. It\'s not a pokemon). For now I can create an user that will have his own pokedex. On the pokedex you can click on the pokeballs. The first one is for the pokemons you have in your pokedex while the second is for the ones you can share with others. It\'s everything for this little first version. Have fun! </p>\r<p>JeCisC</p>',	#date : DateAndTime [ '2016-03-15T00:55:03.398246+01:00' ]}
