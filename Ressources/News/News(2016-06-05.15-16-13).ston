This was caused by the fact that serialized file containing the state of the server was corrupted. This should be fixed now. This is the only thing that should impact the users.</li>\r\t<li><b>Tests and intern documentation:</b> I added somes tests on the model and also a lot of documentation in the code.</li>\r\t<li><b>Cleaning of the dependencies in the code:</b>In the code there was some dependencies between entities that had nothing to do between them. I cleaned that.</li>\r\t<li><b>Clean the code:</b> I cleaned some things in the code. For example there was some wrong code in the login component. Also I used the observer pattern to change of page, now I simplified this to not use this pattern.</li>\r\t<li><b>Created a context to easier the deployment:</b> First I hard coded a lot of things that will make the deployement hard. Now we can configure everything in a configuration file.</li>\r</ul>\r<p>That\'s all for now :) </p>\r<p>JeCisC</p>',	#date : DateAndTime [ '2016-06-05T15:16:13.041001+02:00' ]}
